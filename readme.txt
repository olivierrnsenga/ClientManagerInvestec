This project is all about managing client information smoothly. You can create, update, and view client details easily, and the system checks that the information entered is correct.
To make testing a breeze, I've created some special Razor UI pages. These pages let you test out different parts of the system effortlessly.

Key Features:

  1.Client Management: Manage client info like names and phone numbers effortlessly.

  2.Validation: Ensures that the data entered is correct, like checking if phone numbers are in the right format.

  3.In-Memory Database: We use a special database that's super quick for testing, so there's no risk to real data.

Technologies Used:

  1.C#: The main language used for building the system.
  2.Entity Framework: Helps us communicate with the database easily.
  3.Microsoft Unit Test Framework: Helps us make sure every part of the system works correctly.
  4.In-Memory Database: A fast and simple way to test without affecting real data.
With these technologies, our Client Management system is reliable and easy to test.
